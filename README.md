# Data analysis on Soccer DataBase, SQL using Python.

*The most important component of the DB is creating a tables - that's where all the data stored. 
Usually the data would be divided into many tables, and not stored all in one place (so designing the data stracture propely is very important). 

SQL Main Concepts are 
- table creation
- inserting / updating data in the DB
- functions - gets a value as an input, 
- and returns manipulation of that value (for example function that remove white spaces)

I have collected the data  using SQL Queries.
